# Interview Questions
This repository contains some example answers to interview questions I usually
ask people interviewing for software validation or development roles.  The
primary purpose is so that I have a guideline when evaluating the interviewee's
answer.


In general I like to use the following format for interviews:
* First 20 minutes: programming question
    * Choose from one of the Python files in this repository
    * If possible have a computer connected to the projector in the interview room to allow the candidate to actually implement their solution
    * Grade more on approach and clarity of logic than on if they get a workable solution
    * Increase the difficulty with successive problems and see how the candidate respond to pressure
* Second 20 minutes: system-level design question
    * For software engineers have the candidate create a UML diagram for a client-server or message-queue system
    * For hardware engineers have the candidate create a system diagram of a board that outputs video or audio
    * For validation engineers have the candidate create a test plan for an ECU or the front-end and back-end of an App
* Last 20 minutes: personal experience questions
    * Ask about projects in the candidate's  current or former job that are related to the job posting
    * Ask why the candidate wants to switch jobs
    * Ask about any personal projects that the candidate finds interesting
