# Interview Questions
This repository is an amalgamation of fun math problems I've encountered that
are difficult to solve by hand, but relatively easy to compute the answers.
I've called this repository "Interview Questions" because I this is my stash of
programming problems if I'm ever called upon to proctor a software engineering
interview.
